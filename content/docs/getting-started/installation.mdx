**BreezeUI isn't just another UI component library**

BreezeUI is a complete design system built to give you full control. Instead of locking you into a framework or forcing you into predefined patterns, BreezeUI follows a simple philosophy:

## **Copy → Customize → Own**

You copy the components you need, customize them however you want, and fully own the final result inside your project.

Here’s what makes BreezeUI different:

- **Beautiful Design**: Every component is crafted with clean, modern UI patterns that make your app look professional instantly.
- **Smart Components**: Each component is modular and flexible—mix, match, and build without limitations.
- **Full Ownership**: No vendor lock-in. Once copied, the components belong entirely to your project.
- **Effortless Customization**: Change colors, spacing, fonts, and layouts using simple CSS variables and Tailwind utilities.
- **Clear Documentation**: Straightforward guides, examples, and component previews help you get productive fast.

### Beautiful Design

Every component is responsive, modern, and crafted with attention to detail. You get polished UI elements out of the box.

### Smart Components

BreezeUI components act like building blocks—use them individually or combine them to create more complex UIs.

### Full Ownership

No dependencies. No runtime library. You own every line of code. Modify, extend, or reshape as your project evolves.

### Easy Customization

With CSS variables and Tailwind utilities, styling becomes effortless. Adjust any component to match your brand identity.

### Clear Documentation

We provide clean examples, interactive previews, and copy-ready snippets to help you start building immediately.

## Perfect For

- **Developers** who want high-quality components without restrictions  
- **Teams** that need a consistent design system  
- **Projects** requiring full customization and control  
- **Anyone** building modern, scalable web interfaces
