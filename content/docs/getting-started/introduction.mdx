# Introduction

**BreezeUI is a modern, open-source design system built for developers who want complete freedom.**  
Instead of relying on heavy UI frameworks, BreezeUI gives you clean, production-ready components that you can **copy directly into your project**, customize however you want, and fully own forever.

Most UI libraries force you into their structure. They control your classes, your styling, and how you build. BreezeUI flips that model by giving you **full ownership**, no restrictions, and no hidden dependencies.

## 🌬️ What Is BreezeUI?

BreezeUI is a collection of handcrafted, responsive, and accessible UI components designed for modern web applications.  
Every component is built with **simplicity**, **flexibility**, and **customization** in mind.

You don’t install a package.  
You don’t depend on a runtime.  
You simply:

### **Copy → Customize → Own**

This makes BreezeUI ideal for:

- Developers who want to control their UI code  
- Teams maintaining consistent design across projects  
- Projects where branding and customization matter  
- Anyone who prefers clean, reusable, tailorable components

## 🌟 Why BreezeUI Exists

Most UI libraries solve one problem but introduce a new one:

- Too many dependencies  
- Locked-in design patterns  
- Difficult overrides  
- Extra bundle size  
- Limited flexibility  

BreezeUI was created to solve all of that.

It’s a **design system built for freedom** — you get the structure, patterns, and components, but *you decide how to use them*.

You get:

- Clean UI components  
- Clear design guidelines  
- Tailwind-first styling  
- Fully editable code  
- Zero installation overhead

## 💡 How BreezeUI Works

BreezeUI follows one simple workflow:

1. **Copy the component** you want from the documentation.  
2. **Paste** it into your project.  
3. **Customize it** using your own classes, styles, and logic.  
4. **Own the component** — no external dependency required.

Because every component is local to your project, you can:

- Change colors  
- Modify markup  
- Add animations  
- Replace icons  
- Extend functionality  
- Remove what you don’t need  

Nothing is off-limits.
